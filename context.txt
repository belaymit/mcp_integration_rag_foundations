Business Objective / Background Context
Scenario: NexusAI's business requires intelligent agents to seamlessly access, aggregate, and reason over information scattered across numerous development and productivity tools – project management (JIRA via Atlassian MCP), version control (GitHub MCP), documentation (Google Drive MCP), local codebases (Filesystem MCP), and potentially more. Direct agent interaction with each tool's specific MCP server can become complex and inefficient to manage.

As a new AI Protocol Engineer, your first week focuses on building foundational capabilities for unified tool access. You will explore and interact with various existing MCP servers provided for common tools. You will use MCP client libraries (like Python fastmcp or Typescript fastmcp) to communicate with these servers. A key task will be to design and implement a basic MCP Proxy/Gateway Server. This proxy will act as a single, unified endpoint, intelligently routing requests to the appropriate downstream MCP server (e.g., GitHub, GDrive, Filesystem, Atlassian). You will integrate this proxy into a simple "Dev Assistant" agent (using Python fast-agent or NodeJS LangGraph.js) that performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over a local knowledge base, potentially exploring real-time indexing concepts. You will test the MCP proxy using integrated development environment (IDE) clients like VS Code Copilot Chat or Cursor, and research advanced protocol concepts.

Goal: By the end of this week, you will demonstrate a strong grasp of MCP fundamentals, the ability to interact with various existing MCP servers, experience designing and implementing a basic MCP proxy server, proficiency in building a simple agent (Python or NodeJS) integrating MCP tool use (via the proxy) and RAG (including awareness of real-time indexing), and the ability to test the MCP proxy using standard IDE integrations. You will also gain initial insights into enterprise protocol challenges like unified access and security.

Task 1: Environment Setup & Protocol Study (Est. 4 hours)

Objective: Establish the local development environment and gain a thorough theoretical understanding of MCP, A2A, and the target MCP servers.
Steps:
Choose Agent Path: Decide: Python (fast-agent) or NodeJS (LangGraph.js).
Setup Environment: Clone starter repo (if provided) or create project structure. Follow Appendix C to set up your chosen local environment(s). Install base dependencies (Python/Node, Git, Docker, VS Code/Cursor). Verify interpreters/package managers.
Create Mock KB: Follow Appendix D to create the local mock knowledge base directory structure (for RAG).
MCP/A2A Deep Dive: Read official MCP/A2A specs. Focus on MCP request/response structures.
Explore Target MCP Servers: Review the READMEs and code for the provided MCP servers (GitHub, Filesystem, GDrive, Atlassian). Understand their purpose and basic setup instructions (many might use Docker). Note their default ports.
Document Understanding (Action 1.1): In protocols_understanding.md, explain MCP invoke_method flow. Contrast MCP/A2A use cases. Briefly summarize the function of each target MCP server.
Commit Setup: Commit environment files (e.g., requirements.txt, package.json, Dockerfile if used), mock KB structure, and documentation.
Task 2: Explore & Test Existing MCP Servers (Est. 6 hours)

Objective: Get hands-on experience running and interacting with several pre-built MCP servers using a basic client script.
Steps:
Setup Servers: Following their documentation, set up and run at least three of the provided MCP servers locally (e.g., Filesystem, GitHub, Atlassian). Use Docker if recommended. Note down the local URL/port for each. Configuration (API keys, paths) might be needed.
Build Basic Client Script: Create a simple script (mcp_client_tester.py or .js) using the relevant fastmcp client library (or aiohttp/axios). This script should allow specifying the target MCP server URL and sending basic get_methods and invoke_method requests.
Test Interaction (Action 2.1): Use your client script to call get_methods and attempt a simple invoke_method call relevant to each running server. Print responses/errors.
Document Findings: Briefly document methods available and setup/interaction challenges in mcp_server_exploration.md.
(Optional) Build Simple MCP Server: Use fastmcp framework to build a very simple MCP server (e.g., echo method). Test with your client script.
Commit Code: Commit client tester script, optional simple server, and documentation.
Task 3: Design & Implement MCP Proxy Server (Est. 10 hours)

Objective: Build a basic MCP proxy/gateway server that routes requests to the appropriate downstream MCP server.
Steps:
Setup: Create mcp_proxy_server/. Choose language (Python/FastAPI or NodeJS/Express, likely using fastmcp framework). Add dependencies. Create proxy_server.py (or .js), config.py (or .js).
Design Routing Logic: Decide how the proxy will determine the downstream server (e.g., prefix-based /github/mcp/..., header-based X-Target-MCP, etc.). Choose a simple approach (e.g., prefix-based).
Configuration: In config.py (or .js), define a mapping from your routing key (e.g., 'github') to the downstream MCP server's local URL (from Task 2).
Implement Proxy Endpoint (Action 3.1): Create the main request handling endpoint(s). This endpoint should receive the MCP request, determine the target server, look up its URL, forward the original request payload, receive the response, and return it. Handle errors (unknown target, downstream unavailable). Add logging.
(Optional) Implement get_methods Aggregation: Implement /mcp/get_methods on the proxy to call and aggregate get_methods from all downstream servers.
Run & Test Manually: Run your proxy server and ensure downstream servers are running. Use your client script (or Postman/curl) to send requests to the proxy. Verify routing and responses. Test error cases.
Write Tests (Action 3.2): Create test_proxy_server.py (or .js). Use testing frameworks and mocking (mock downstream HTTP calls) to test routing, payload forwarding, response returning, and error handling.
Commit Code: Commit proxy server code, configuration, tests.
Task 4: Implement Basic RAG Agent with MCP Integration (Est. 8 hours)

Objective: Build an agent that uses the MCP Proxy to get data and uses basic RAG (with awareness of real-time concepts) to find related info in the local mock knowledge base.
Steps (Choose ONE path - Python or NodeJS):
Setup: Create dev_assistant_agent_py/ or dev_assistant_agent_node/. Add agent framework, RAG library (llama-index or langchain), MCP client dependencies, and potentially pathway (Python). Create agent.py/.js, rag_setup.py/.js, run.py/.js.
Implement RAG Setup (Action 4.1A/B): In rag_setup.py/.js:
LlamaIndex: Use SimpleDirectoryReader to load documents from mock_knowledge_base. Use an embedding model (e.g., local sentence-transformers or API-based). Create a VectorStoreIndex from the documents. Create a QueryEngine from the index (index.as_query_engine()). Encapsulate this in a function/class.
LangChain JS: Use document loaders, splitters, embeddings, and a vector store (e.g., MemoryVectorStore) to create a retriever.
(Conceptual) Real-time Indexing: Review the Pathway Document Indexing Example. In a separate markdown file (realtime_rag_notes.md), briefly explain how Pathway's approach differs from the static indexing done above (e.g., watching a directory, updating the index incrementally). No implementation required this week.
Implement Agent (Action 4.2A/B): In agent.py/.js:
Define Agent class/graph. Instantiate RAG QueryEngine/Retriever.
Instantiate an MCP Client configured to talk to your MCP Proxy Server (Task 3).
Implement a message handler/graph node taking a user query (e.g., "Tell me about GitHub issue #5 related to file Y").
Parse query to identify target tool and request details.
Call MCP via Proxy: Use MCP client to send invoke_method to the proxy. Store result.
Call RAG: Use the RAG query engine/retriever with the query/keywords. Store result.
Synthesize: Combine MCP result and RAG context into a response.
Return response. Handle errors. Add logging.
Run Script: Create run.py/.js to start the agent.
Write Unit Tests (Action 4.3A/B): Create test_agent.py/.js. Mock MCP Client calls and RAG query engine. Test agent logic (parsing, MCP call, RAG call, synthesis, errors).
Commit Code: Commit agent, RAG setup, run script, tests, and realtime_rag_notes.md.
 
Task 5: Research Advanced MCP Concepts (Est. 3 hours)

Objective: Explore concepts relevant to scaling and securing MCP in an enterprise environment.
Steps:
Reading Task: Read provided research articles/links (API Gateways, Security, Streaming). Review MCP Gateway inspirations (OpenMCP, Metatool).
Concept Exploration: Research MCP Gateway possibilities beyond basic routing (auth, rate limiting, transformation), RBAC for MCP methods, and MCP Streaming concepts.
Document Design Ideas (Action 5.1): Create advanced_mcp_concepts.md. Explain each concept (Advanced Gateway, RBAC, Streaming) in MCP context, discuss benefits/challenges for NexusAI, outline high-level conceptual designs.
Commit Documentation: Commit advanced_mcp_concepts.md.
Task 6: Test MCP Proxy with IDE Integration (Est. 3 hours)

Objective: Configure and use IDE-based MCP clients (VS Code Copilot Chat or Cursor) to interact with your MCP Proxy Server.
Steps:
Ensure Servers Running: Make sure your downstream MCP Servers (Task 2) and your MCP Proxy Server (Task 3) are running locally. Note the URL of the proxy server.
Configure IDE (Action 6.1):
VS Code: Follow the Copilot Chat MCP documentation to add your running MCP Proxy Server URL to the github.copilot.chat.mcp.include setting in your VS Code settings.json. Reload VS Code.
Cursor: Follow the Cursor MCP documentation to add your MCP Proxy Server URL via its configuration interface (e.g., @mcp command or settings).
Test via IDE Chat (Action 6.2): Open the chat interface in your configured IDE (Copilot Chat panel or Cursor chat). Send queries that should utilize your proxy and downstream servers. Examples
"@workspace /mcp invoke_method filesystem list_files {'path': './mock_knowledge_base/code'}" (Adjust path as needed)
"@workspace /mcp invoke_method github get_user_info {'username': 'some_github_user'}" (Requires GitHub MCP server running & configured)
"@workspace /mcp invoke_method atlassian get_issue {'issue_key': 'NEX-123'}" (Requires Atlassian MCP server running & configured)
(Note: Exact syntax for invoking methods might vary slightly between IDEs/versions - consult their docs)
Verify Responses: Check if the IDE chat receives the expected JSON responses (or errors) forwarded from the downstream servers via your proxy. Check proxy server logs for incoming requests.
Document Process (Action 6.3): Create ide_mcp_integration.md. Document the steps taken to configure your chosen IDE, the test queries used, and the observed results (success/failure, responses). Include screenshots if helpful.
Commit Documentation: Commit ide_mcp_integration.md.
Task 7: Documentation & Stand-up Preparation (Est. 2 hours)

Objective: Finalize documentation and prepare for stand-ups.
Steps:
Update README: Explain the overall architecture (Downstream Servers -> Proxy -> Agent -> IDE Client). Detail how to set up and run each component. Reference all documentation (protocols_understanding.md, mcp_server_exploration.md, realtime_rag_notes.md, advanced_mcp_concepts.md, ide_mcp_integration.md).
Daily Stand-up Prep: Prepare concise daily updates (Done / Doing / Blockers).
Final Commit & Push: Ensure all code, tests, documentation are committed and pushed.

Agent Framework & RAG (Task 4):
(Tailor to chosen framework: fast-agent or LangGraph.js) "Show the basic structure for defining an agent..."
"Provide a LlamaIndex example using SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex, and as_query_engine()."
"Explain the core idea behind real-time RAG indexing as shown in the Pathway demo-document-indexing example."
"How can my agent parse a user query like 'Get GitHub issue #50' to determine the target service ('GitHub') and parameters ({'issue_number': 50})?"
Testing (Task 3, 4, 6):
"How can I use pytest and aioresponses (or httpx.mock) to test an async Python function that makes an HTTP call?"
"How can I mock external HTTP calls in Jest for testing a Node.js function?"
"How do I configure VS Code Copilot Chat to use a local MCP server running at http://localhost:8002/proxy/mcp?"
"What is the syntax for invoking an MCP method via Cursor's chat?"

Appendices
Appendix A: Protocol Overviews (Simplified)
Model Context Protocol (MCP) Summary:

Purpose: Standardizes how AI agents access external tools and data sources (like APIs, databases, files). It acts like a universal adapter.
Problem Solved: Prevents needing custom code for every single tool an agent might use. Creates a consistent way for agents to discover and interact with tools.
Key Components:
MCP Server: Wraps around an existing tool/API and exposes its functionality via the MCP standard methods.
MCP Client: Used by the agent to communicate with MCP Servers.
Methods: Standardized operations like get_methods (discover what the tool can do), invoke_method (use a specific tool function).
Interaction: Agent -> MCP Client -> MCP Server -> Tool/API
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Summary:

Purpose: Enables different AI agents (potentially built by different teams or using different frameworks) to communicate and collaborate securely and effectively.
Problem Solved: Lack of a standard way for agents to talk to each other, discover capabilities, and orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple specialized agents.
Key Components:
Transport: Uses common web technologies like HTTP/WebSockets.
Messaging Format: Primarily uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for requests/responses.
Asynchronous Events: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for push notifications/updates from one agent to another.
Discovery: Uses "Agent Cards" – standardized descriptions of an agent's capabilities, allowing other agents to find and understand how to interact with them.
Security: Recommends standards like OAuth 2.1 / OpenID Connect for secure authentication and authorization between agents.
Interaction: Agent 1 -> Agent 2 (via A2A Interface)

Your MCP JIRA Server (Task 2) will read this file.
Mock GitHub Data (Code Snippets):
Create a subdirectory mock_knowledge_base/code/.
Create simple text files representing code commits or snippets mentioned in JIRA tickets. Example mock_knowledge_base/code/commit_abc123.py:
# Fix for NEX-123: Adjusted login button CSS
def apply_mobile_styles(button_element):
    if screen_width < 480:
        button_element.style.marginLeft = 'auto';
        button_element.style.marginRight = 'auto';
    # ... other styles
Create another for commit_def456.py.
Mock Google Drive Data (Docs):
Create a subdirectory mock_knowledge_base/docs/.
Create simple markdown files representing documentation mentioned in JIRA tickets. Example mock_knowledge_base/docs/login_feature.md:
# Login Feature Documentation

This document describes the user login flow.
## UI Elements
- Username field
- Password field
- Login Button (See ui_guidelines.md for styling)
## Known Issues
- Alignment on mobile (NEX-123)
Create other files like ui_guidelines.md, mcp_server_design.md, etc., with brief relevant content.
Mock JIRA Summaries (for RAG):
Create a subdirectory mock_knowledge_base/tickets/.

Ticket: NEX-123
Summary: Fix login button alignment on mobile
Description: The login button is slightly off-center on screens smaller than 480px.
Status: Done
Refs: commit_abc123, PR #45, ui_guidelines.md, login_feature.md
 
RAG Target: Your RAG pipeline (Task 4) should be configured to index all files within the mock_knowledge_base directory (including subdirectories).
Appendix D: IT Setup Guide
(This should be provided to the trainee)

Objective: Set up a consistent Dockerized Python development environment.

Prerequisites:

Docker Desktop installed and running.
Git installed.
A terminal or command prompt.
A code editor (like VS Code) with Docker integration (recommended).
Steps:

Clone Repository:
git clone <instructor_provided_repository_url> week1-challenge
cd week1-challenge

 
Review Files: Familiarize yourself with the provided files:
Dockerfile: Defines how to build the Docker image with Python and dependencies.
docker-compose.yml: Defines the service(s) to run using the Docker image (makes running easier).
requirements.txt: Lists Python libraries needed (initially might include pytest, pytest-asyncio, aiohttp, and the chosen agent framework like fastagent or letta).
Potentially skeleton Python files (worker_agent.py, etc.).
Build and Start Container: Open your terminal in the week1-challenge directory and run:
docker-compose up --build -d

 
--build: Tells Docker Compose to build the image based on the Dockerfile if it doesn't exist or if the Dockerfile changed.
-d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
Troubleshooting: If the build fails, check the output for errors (e.g., typos in requirements.txt, network issues).
Access Container Terminal: You need to run commands inside the container.
Find the container name/ID: docker ps (Look for an image name related to the project, e.g., week1-challenge_app_1).
Execute a bash shell inside the container:
docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash

You should now see a prompt like root@<container_id>:/app#. You are inside the container!
Verify Environment: Inside the container terminal, check installations:
python --version
pip list | grep pytest # Check if key packages are installed

 
Working with Code:
The docker-compose.yml likely sets up a volume mount, meaning the code files in your week1-challenge directory on your host machine are mirrored inside the container (usually at /app).
Edit code on your host machine using your preferred code editor (VS Code).
Run code and tests inside the container terminal you opened in step 4. For example:
# Inside the container terminal
python async_practice.py
pytest test_async_practice.py

 
Installing New Packages: If you need to add a library (like aiohttp):
Add the library name (e.g., aiohttp) to the requirements.txt file on your host machine.
Stop the running containers: docker-compose down (in the terminal on your host machine, in the project directory).
Rebuild and restart: docker-compose up --build -d
Access the container terminal again (step 4). The new package should be installed.
Stopping the Environment: When finished for the day, run this command in the terminal on your host machine (in the project directory):
docker-compose down
